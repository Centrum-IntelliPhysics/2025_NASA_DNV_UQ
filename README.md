The challenge jointly posed by NASA and DNV is described in detail in the file UQ_Challenge.pdf. This repository contains the machine learning codes developed to address the NASA-DNV Challenge on Optimization under Uncertainty 2025.

Our work is presented in the UQ Challenge Sessions at the 35th European Safety and Reliability (ESREL) Conference held in Norway. You can access the published paper through this **[link](https://rpsonline.com.sg/proceedings/esrel-sra-e2025/html/ESREL-SRA-E2025-P7698.html)**, and a recorded presentation is available **[here](https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/sgoswam4_jh_edu/Eo6XL-LpD6ZOi9YAEh4gbqYBnehYqBaV6ees0N68VL0sPA?e=hIcXBC)**
